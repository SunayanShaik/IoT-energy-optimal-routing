# IoT-energy-optimal-routing
Design a Routing Protocol for internet of things considering the energy as a constraint. Create a topology and simulate packet flow using various sources nodes which is consumed by a gateway sink. Control the path taken by packet to reach gateway using the energy available on a node as a parameter.
